# P_RATFOR
The source code of the RATFOR preprocessor for SuperSoft fortran  for CP/M has been restored

In rlee peter's cp/m archive /rlee/M/MORROW/BACKUPS/M10/D1/
the source files of the RATFOR for the SuperSoft fortran compilerfor CP/M preprocessor were discovered.
However, the original included "FCOMMON.FOR" file was missing from this archive. The absence of this file made it impossible to create an executable file of the RATFOR preprocessor for SuperSoft fortran for CP/M.

Martin made an attempt to write a replacement for this file and described his work.

Except for the new included file "FCOMMON.FOR"  for compilation, Martin had to slightly change the source file of the preprocessor itself. After that, the compilation began to run successfully.

This repository contains

Martin_work.txt

FCOMMON.FOR - new included file

RATFOR.RAT - corrected version of the source file

RATDEFS.RAT - file with RATFOR definitions

To compile, you need to run several commands
described by Martin.
